# VESC-4-derivative-
Single-sided layout technology is adopted to eliminate the infrequent interfaces such as the Hall interface and SPI interface and reduce the volume;
Supports all basic functions of the sensorless motor of VESC (inability to use inductive functions, including Hall and magnetic encoders), accurate sampling, and perfect operation after setting motor parameters;
You can use DRV8301 or DRV8302 driver;
low cost
The current depends on the MOS and heat dissipation, the maximum theoretical current 160A, the maximum support 12S battery;
Supports +-0.5% speed closed loop, comes with 1.5A BEC;
Supports regenerative braking, full synchronous rectification, quick braking, responsive response, start-up performance depending on start-up parameter settings;
Support FOC, more suitable for low speed high torque motor drive;
Do not use for commercialization, only for personal DIY use
